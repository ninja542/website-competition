      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p> Food is necessary for survival. It is a &ldquo;need&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite an obvious statement, but we don&rsquo;t think of food as an extreme basic anymore. No. We evolved food into a social activity. We escalated food to fine art. Out of the things that we regard highly, food is certainly one that has stood the tests of time.</p>
      <p> A great example is the word &ldquo;Companionship&rdquo;. It means friend, right? But the word means &ldquo;one who breaks bread with another" in Latin. Food to us is much more than just food. It&rsquo;s culture. It&rsquo;s social. It&rsquo;s art. </p>

      <p> Food holds an infinite number of significances for different people. A person might see it as a connection back to their homeland. Another might see food as a journey into taste. Another might see it as a way just to earn money. </p>
      <p> Don&rsquo;t hold so dearly to your rigid recipes, and embrace the dynamics of food. Recipes are not entirely bad. But when you feel like you&rsquo;re falling into the same dull routine, stop. </p>
      <p> Take a breath. </p>
      <p> And experiment. </p>
      <p> Please, enjoy the journey. Even if you&rsquo;re not a self-proclaimed &ldquo;foodie&rdquo;, appreciating food can bring a sense of specialty into your day. It&rsquo;s the little things that count. </p>
