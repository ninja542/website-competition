      <h1> Street Food in Taiwan </h1>
      <p> I have been to Taiwan once. But I enjoyed it immensely. I got to meet my relatives, and the best thing was the food. Food you could not get in Michigan. It was almost like heaven. </p> 
      <p> Taiwan has a lot of street food, or small eats, &ldquo;xiaochi&rdquo;, which are relatively cheap. Tiny food carts can be found everywhere on the streets, the wonderful aroma wafting over, tempting you. It's not over yet. The main places for getting food are the night markets.</p>

      <p> Night markets are big, crowded, and noisy but the food is like a comforting blanket, enveloping you in warmth.</p>

      <p> Recently, it has been popular for tourists as well, as it is a good place to eat some of Taiwan's ethnic foods. Popular staples of night markets include stinky tofu, oyster omelet, shaved ice, iron eggs, hujiao bing, beef noodle soup, scallion pancakes, and of course more. </p>

      <p> The sights in Taiwan were amazing, but it was definitely the food that made my vacation special. </p>
